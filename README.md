Data
Data contains 2 sets for data for rejected and accepted loans, from the Lending club, between 2007 to 2018 Quarter 4. \ We will look at the accepted loans and only a subset of the columns (see list below)

Business summary

Goal
To develop a classification model that predicts the "loan status" of a loan
